## Gameplay Mechanics: Tension in Every Decision

### Core Gameplay Loop
The genius of **Buckshot Roulette** lies in its deceptively simple mechanics. Players face "The Dealer" in a dimly lit underground venue where every round is a calculated risk:

🎯 **The Setup**: The Dealer loads a 12-gauge shotgun with a mix of live shells and blanks
🤔 **The Choice**: Point the gun at yourself or your opponent and pull the trigger
💀 **The Consequence**: Live shells deal damage, blanks are safe—but you never know which is which

### Progressive Difficulty System
The game escalates tension through three increasingly challenging rounds:

| **Round** | **Health Points** | **Difficulty** | **Stakes** |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Round 1** | 2 HP | Learning the ropes | Introduction to mechanics |
| **Round 2** | 4 HP | Strategic depth | Items and complexity |
| **Round 3** | 5 HP | **Sudden Death** | One mistake = game over |

- **🔍 Magnifying Glass**: Peek at the next shell
- **🚬 Cigarettes**: Restore health
- **⚡ Defibrillator**: Emergency revival
- **🔧 Tools**: Various tactical advantages

## Game Modes: Multiple Ways to Experience Terror

### 🎮 Story Mode
The core single-player experience where you battle through three rounds against The Dealer. Each victory unlocks new challenges and deeper psychological horror.

### 🎲 Double or Nothing Mode
**Risk everything for greater rewards.** This post-game mode lets victorious players push their luck further—but failure means starting from absolute zero.
