##  Overview

*Buckshot Roulette* is a tense, tabletop-style horror game that reimagines the lethal suspense of Russian roulette using a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun instead of a revolver. Developed rapidly and with a gritty aesthetic, it gained rapid popularity as an indie favorite.

##  Gameplay Mechanics

- **Core premise**: Face "The Dealer" in a slick, underground nightclub. The Dealer loads a shotgun with a mix of live shells and blanks; you decide whether to pull the trigger on yourself or your opponent.
- **Lives and rounds**:  
  - **Round 1**: 2 HP  
  - **Round 2**: 4 HP  
  - **Round 3**: 5 HP  
  You and the Dealer share health and life-defibrillator charges; Round 3 introduces *sudden death*—lose, and you must restart.
- **Items add strategic depth** (introduced in Steam updates, including “Double or Nothing” mode on release and special items in multiplayer)}.
