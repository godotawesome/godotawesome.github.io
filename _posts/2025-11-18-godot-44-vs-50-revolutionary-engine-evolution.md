```gdscript
# Godot 5.0 - New multithreading capabilities
extends Node

func _ready():
    # New parallel processing syntax
    var tasks = [
        TaskRunner.create_task(load_world_data),
        TaskRunner.create_task(initialize_physics),
        TaskRunner.create_task(setup_audio)
    ]
    
    await TaskRunner.wait_for_all(tasks)
    print("All systems initialized in parallel!")
```

#### **3. AI-Assisted Development**
- **Built-in code completion** powered by machine learning

| **Particle Systems** | 100K particles | 1M+ particles |
| **Memory Usage** | Standard | 30% reduction |
| **Mobile Performance** | Good | Exceptional |

### **Development Workflow**

```gdscript
# Godot 4.4 - Current approach
class_name Player extends CharacterBody2D

var speed = 300.0
var jump_velocity = -400.0

func _physics_process(delta):
    handle_gravity(delta)
    handle_input()
    move_and_slide()
```

```gdscript
# Godot 5.0 - Enhanced component system
@component
class_name MovementComponent extends Node

@export var speed: float = 300.0
@export var jump_velocity: float = -400.0

@auto_connect
func _physics_process(delta: float):
    # Improved physics integration
    apply_movement_with_prediction(delta)
```
