### Your First Model: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Let's create a simple character model to get you familiar with BlockBench's interface:

#### Step 1: Create a New Project
- Launch BlockBench
- Click "New Project"
- Choose "Generic Model" for Godot compatibility
- Set your texture resolution (64x64 or 128x128 for low-poly aesthetics)

#### Step 2: Basic Modeling
- Use the **Cube Tool** to add basic shapes
- Resize and position cubes using the transform handles
- Build your character's basic silhouette (head, body, arms, legs)

#### Step 3: Texturing
- Switch to the **Paint** tab
- Use the built-in tools to paint directly on your model
- Create color palettes for consistent styling
- Apply textures to different model parts

#### Step 4: Animation Setup
- Switch to the **Animate** tab
- Create bone groups for different body parts
- Set up a simple walk cycle or idle animation
- Use keyframes to define movement

#### Step 5: Export for Godot
- Go to **File** > **Export**
- Choose **glTF 2.0** format for best Godot compatibility
- Save your model and textures

## Advanced BlockBench Techniques

### Optimizing Models for Godot Engine

When creating models for Godot, keep these optimization tips in mind:

**Polygon Count Management:**
- Keep vertex counts reasonable for your target platform
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) techniques for distant objects
- Remove unnecessary internal faces

**Texture Optimization:**
- Use power-of-2 texture sizes (64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
- Combine multiple textures into texture atlases
- Use appropriate compression settings in Godot

**Animation Best Practices:**
- Keep bone counts manageable
- Use linear interpolation for retro aesthetics
- Optimize animation curves to reduce file size

### Creating Modular Assets

BlockBench excels at creating modular, reusable assets:

1. **Design with Modularity in Mind**: Create separate models for different parts
2. **Consistent Scaling**: Maintain uniform scales across all assets
3. **Shared Textures**: Use common texture palettes across multiple models
4. **Snap-Together Design**: Design pieces that fit together perfectly

## BlockBench to Godot Workflow

Here's the optimal workflow for using BlockBench models in Godot:

### Export Settings
```
Format: glTF 2.0 (.gltf + .bin + textures)
Settings:
- Export Animations: âœ“
- Export Textures: âœ“
- Embed Textures: âœ— (for better organization)
```

### Import in Godot
1. **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag your .gltf file into Godot's FileSystem
2. **Import Settings**: Adjust import settings if needed
3. **Scene Setup**: Add your model to a scene as a MeshInstance3D
4. **Material Setup**: Fine-tune materials in Godot's material editor

### Animation Integration
- Import animations will appear in Godot's AnimationPlayer
- Use Godot's animation features to blend and control animations
- Combine with code for interactive character controllers
